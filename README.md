## Inspiration
Inspired by the combination of Star Wars features and an adorable whale riding colorful tides as the main avatar, we present to you a world where two settings— the space and the ocean— collide. Contrary to the typical usage of keys as controls in video games, we wanted to create something that allows for a fun, interactive video game experience that incorporates physical gestures as controls, hence the birth of our video game — Star Whales. 

## What it does
This video game serves as a fun, stress-reliever that provides users with a taste of the Xbox gaming experience, where you could activate the superpowers of the whale using hand gestures to protect it from the floating obstacles. 

## How we built it
In incorporating controls through hand gestures into the video game, we utilised Handtrack.js, a library for prototyping realtime hand-detection. On top of that, we used Planck.js, a physics engine for game development, to build the collision detector which allows us to set up the point system for the game. 

## Challenges we ran into
We were faced with the challenges of coming up with the configurations of the obstacles and superpowers but we had fun building superpowers for our adorable whale.  

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

👨‍💻 Deploying the game on [GitHub Pages](https://google.com)!

💪 Getting a highscore of **170** without straining our arm muscles.

😤 Finishing a proper hackathon submission before hell week (7 midterms + 1 essay)

## What we learned
1. Physics engine with Plank.js
2. Machine learning with Handtrack.js

## What's next for Star Whales
⚡ More power ups! 
🎮 Multiplayer mode!
